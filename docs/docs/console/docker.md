# Docker Installation

The quickest and easiest way to install the ThreatStryker Management Console is to use the pre-built images.  These instructions use pre-built ThreatStryker containers from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/deepfenceio).

You can install the Management Console on a single Docker host or [in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](kubernetes).

## Install the ThreatStryker Management Console - Single Docker Host

The following instructions explain how to get started with a docker-based installation on a single host system:

1. To authenticate to the Quay registry, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker login quay.io
    ```

    When prompted, please provide the credentials sent by email.

2. Download the file [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.deepfence.io/threatstryker/files/v2.0/docker-compose.yml) to the system that will host the Console

    ```bash
    wget https://docs.deepfence.io/threatstryker/files/v2.0/docker-compose.yml
    ```

   For more verbose network alerts, please download this file instead: [docker-compose.yml ðŸ”—](https://docs.deepfence.io/threatstryker/files/v2.0/docker-compose-poc.yml).

    ```bash
    wget https://docs.deepfence.io/threatstryker/files/v2.0/docker-compose-poc.yml -O docker-compose.yml
    ```

3. Execute the following command to install and start the latest build of the Console

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Now proceed to the [Initial Configuration](initial-configuration).

### Remove the ThreatStryker Management Console

Remove the ThreatStryker Management Console as follows:

```bash
docker compose down
```

You can then prune the images and volumes if they are no longer required:

```bash
docker image prune
docker volume prune
```
