# Register a Sensor Agent with Deepfence Cloud

:::tip
If you are installing docker agent or kuberntes agent, in the console select '**settings**' from side bar and select '**Agent setup**', this page shows commands for installing agents on docker and kuberntes, the same page appears first time when no agents are configured to connect to the console
:::

To register a ThreatStryer agent, you need two items of information:

 * The management console DNS name, which is constructed from the identifier you provided, and can be observed in your browser
 * A valid API key for that management console, which can be obtained from the User Management page in the console UI

You can then follow the [Deploying Sensor Agents](/docs/sensors/) instructions to proceed.
