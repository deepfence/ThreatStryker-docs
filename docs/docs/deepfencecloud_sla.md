# Service Level Agreement for Deepfence Cloud


This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is subject to the terms of the applicable Terms of Service for the Deepfence Cloud Service Offering. Capitalized terms not defined in this SLA will have the meanings specified in the Terms of Service. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the Terms of Service for the Service Offering.

Deepfence will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each class of service purchased for an identified user of an instance of a Service Offering ("you" or "Customer") is "Available" during a given calendar month equal to the “Availability Commitment” at 99.9%

Reports of unavailability should be reported immediately to your Deepfence support contact, or support@deepfence.io. Should Deepfence fail to meet the "Availability Commitment" during a calendar month, and this failure is evidenced by Deepfence's monitoring tools, Deepfence may compensate the affected users accordingly. Any compensation will be limited to 100% of the subscription fee for that calendar month. Failures will only be considered if they are reported in a timely fashion to support@deepfence.io.
