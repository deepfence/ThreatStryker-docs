For detailed instructions on integrations, refer to the corresponding appropriate documentation:

 * [Slack Integration](../Integrations/slack)
 * [Sumo Logic Integration](../Integrations/sumo-logic)
 * [Terraform Integration](../Integrations/terraform)


:::info
ThreatStryker and ThreatMapper behave identically with respect to integrations, although ThreatStryker can raise a much broader set of notifications and alerts.
