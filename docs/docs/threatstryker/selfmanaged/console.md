## Requirements


The system requirements for the ThreatStryker Management Console are as follows:

| Property | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| CPU: No of cores | 8 |
| RAM | 16 GB or 32GB |
| Disk space | At-least 120 GB |
| Port to be opened to view the UI and receive senser agent traffic | 443 |

## Preparation

Download and extract the Deepfence Deployment Kit (link provided by email), and make a note of the license key from
the license email shared with you. It should be on the following lines.

| Property | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| License key | xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx |
| Company name | xxxx corp |         
| Number of hosts | 10 |  
| Admin email | xxxx@xxxx.com |             


The deployment kit contains documentation and installation scripts for the deepfence console
and the deepfence agent components, as a zip file. Please extract the zip file:

1. Copy the contents of the directory **installation_scripts/docker_linux/deepfence_console** to the VM or
host where deepfence console is to be installed
1. Copy the contents of the directory
**installation_scripts/docker_linux/deepfence_agent** to Linux VM or host where deepfence
agent is to be installed

In the event a Kubernetes cluster is being used:

 * Copy the directory
**installation_scripts/docker_linux/deepfence_agent** to the Kubernetes master node

If the deepfence agent is to be installed on Windows based VM or hosts:

 * Use the script in
the directory **installation_scripts/docker_windows/deepfence_agent**

## Docker Install

The host or VM to be used for the Deepfence management console needs to have the docker runtime installed. In addition, it also needs the binary **docker-compose** to be installed on it.

1. Go to the directory **installation_scripts/docker_linux/deepfence_console**.  To authenticate to the docker image repository, run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker login quay.io
   ```

   When prompted, please provide the credentials sent by email.

1.  If docker-compose is not installed, install it: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

1.  Run docker-compose file in that directory as follows:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```


Helm Chart Install
---------------------------------------


1. Add helm repo:

   ```bash
   helm repo add deepfence https://deepfence-helm-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise
   helm repo update
   helm search repo deepfence/deepfence-console
   ```

1. Run following command:

   ```bash
   helm install deepfence-router deepfence/deepfence-router
   helm install deepfence-console deepfence/deepfence-console \
       --set registry.username=<deepfence_username> \
       --set registry.password=<deepfence_password> \
       --set image.tag=3.6.0
   ```

   The Quay username and password is provided by email. Check the README inside the package for detailed setup instructions.

   ```bash
   helm show readme deepfence/deepfence-console
   helm show values deepfence/deepfence-console
   ```

1.  To get the management console ip address, run following command: ::

   ```bash
   kubectl get --namespace default svc deepfence-router -w
   ```

1.  To delete deepfence console helm chart, run following command: ::

   ```bash
   helm delete deepfence-router
   helm delete deepfence-console
   ```
