# Deploying ThreatStryker Consoles


Any **admin** user in your Deepfence Cloud organization can deploy a ThreatStryker management console.  Once deployed, any user in the organization can access that console without any additional login steps.

:::caution
Deepfence Cloud currently uses the term **workload** to refer to a ThreatStryker console.  This will be updated to the term **console** and the following documentation uses the new term.
:::

### Task 1 - Deploy a new ThreatStryker Console


1.  Log in to the Deepfence Cloud portal.
1.  From the home page, select the 'New Console' tile.  This will prompt you for the following information:

    ![Add a new Workload](../img/cloud-newworkload.png)

    Provide an *identifier*, select a console type, and select a region where that console should be deployed.

:::info
The identifier you provide will be used to construct a DNS name. You'll use that DNS name to refer to your console when you  install ThreatStryker sensor agents.
:::

The request to deploy the console is quickly registered. Deployment can take a few minutes and the console will be marked as **Ready** in Deepfence Cloud once deployment is complete. Any errors during deployment are displayed in Deepfence Cloud, and also sent by email.

### Task 2 - Access a ThreatStryker Console

1.  Log in to the Deepfence Cloud portal.
1.  From the home page, click on one of the tiles representing existing ThreatStryker consoles.  This action will load the console in your browser.

You can quickly switch between different console instances from your browser, or return **Home** to the list of console tiles.

### Task 3 - Delete a ThreatStryker Console


1.  Log in to the Deepfence Cloud portal.
1.  From the home page, locate the tile representing the ThreatStryker console to be deleted.  Click the 'Delete' icon, and enter the console's identifer to confirm the permanent deletion of that console and its data.
