# Installing ThreatStryker

The ThreatStryker product consists of a Management Console, and multiple Sensor Agents and Cloud Scanner tasks that are deployed within your production platform(s).

The Management Console is deployed first. The Management console generates an API key and a URL which you will need when you install the Cloud Scanner tasks and Sensor Agents.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
