# Register a Sensor Agent with Deepfence Cloud

To register a ThreatStryer agent, you need two items of information:

 * The management console DNS name, which is constructed from the identifier you provided, and can be observed in your browser
 * A valid API key for that management console, which can be obtained from the User Management page in the console UI

You can then follow the [Deploying Sensor Agents](../sensors/) instructions to proceed.
