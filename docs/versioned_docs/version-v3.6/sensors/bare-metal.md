# Bare-Metal or VM

*Deployed on a Docker runtime*


On a Linux-based bare-metal or virtual machine workload, the ThreatStryker sensor agents are deployed within a lightweight docker runtime which should be installed on the host Linux operating system.

## ThreatStryker Agents

Install a docker runtime on the Linux host.

Install the ThreatStryker sensor agents as you would for a Docker host: [ThreatStryker Agents (Linux)](docker#threatstryker-agents-linux).

For Windows Server hosts, experimental support exists but it is not suitable for production use.
